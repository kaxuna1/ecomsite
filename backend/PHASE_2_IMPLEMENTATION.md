        "answer": "For optimal results, apply the serum twice daily - once in the morning and once before bed. The lightweight formula absorbs quickly and won't weigh down your hair. Most users notice improvements in scalp health within 2-3 weeks of consistent use.",
        "category": "usage"
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this serum safe for color-treated hair?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Revitalizing Scalp Serum is completely safe for color-treated hair. The formula is sulfate-free and designed to nourish your scalp without affecting hair color. Many of our customers with colored hair report that the serum actually helps maintain vibrant color by promoting overall hair health.",
        "category": "suitability"
      },
      {
        "question": "What ingredients make this serum effective?",
        "answer": "The serum features a powerful blend of biotin for hair strength, caffeine to stimulate follicles, argan oil for deep moisture, and tea tree extract for scalp health. Each ingredient is clinically researched and works synergistically to promote healthier, fuller-looking hair.",
        "category": "ingredients"
      },
      {
        "question": "When will I see results from using this serum?",
        "answer": "Most users notice initial improvements like reduced scalp irritation within 1-2 weeks. Visible hair growth and thickness improvements typically become apparent after 4-6 weeks of consistent use. For best results, commit to the full 90-day treatment cycle recommended by dermatologists.",
        "category": "results"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this serum if I have sensitive skin?",
        "answer": "Yes, the formula is hypoallergenic and dermatologist-tested for sensitive skin. All ingredients are natural and free from harsh chemicals, parabens, and artificial fragrances. However, we recommend doing a patch test on a small area before full application if you have known sensitivities.",
        "category": "suitability"
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the main benefits of this scalp serum?",

        "category": "benefits"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I apply the serum correctly?",
        "answer": "Apply the serum directly to your scalp on clean, dry hair. Use the dropper to place small amounts across your scalp, then gently massage in circular motions for 1-2 minutes. There's no need to rinse - the serum absorbs completely and works throughout the day or night.",
        "category": "usage"
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the $49.99 price justified for this product?",
        "answer": "At $49.99, you're getting a 60-day supply of clinically-formulated serum with premium ingredients. This works out to less than $1 per day for professional-grade scalp care. The concentration of active ingredients and proven results make it a worthwhile investment compared to salon treatments costing hundreds of dollars.",

      }
    ],
    "faqSchemaMarkup": "{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"about\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Product\",\n    \"name\": \"Revitalizing Scalp Serum\"\n  },\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"How often should I use the Revitalizing Scalp Serum?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"For optimal results, apply the serum twice daily...\"\n      }\n    }\n    // ...

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture

All Phase 2 features follow the same architecture pattern:

1. **Feature Class** implements `IAIFeature` interface
2. **System Prompt** provides domain expertise and guidelines
3. **User Prompt** contains specific product/campaign data
4. **JSON Response** parsed and validated
5. **Cost Tracking** logged to database
6. **Caching** reduces duplicate API calls
7. **Rate Limiting** prevents abuse

### File Structure

  if (!aiServiceManager) {
    aiServiceManager = new AIServiceManager(aiServiceConfig);
    await aiServiceManager.initialize();

    // Phase 1 features

    aiServiceManager.registerFeature(descriptionGenerator);

    const seoGenerator = new SEOGenerator(aiServiceManager);
    aiServiceManager.registerFeature(seoGenerator);

    const altTextGenerator = new ImageAltTextGenerator(aiServiceManager);
    aiServiceManager.registerFeature(altTextGenerator);

    // Phase 2 features (NEW)
    const productTranslator = new ProductTranslator(aiServiceManager);
    aiServiceManager.registerFeature(productTranslator);

    const emailCampaignGenerator = new EmailCampaignGenerator(aiServiceManager);
    aiServiceManager.registerFeature(emailCampaignGenerator);

    const faqGenerator = new FAQGenerator(aiServiceManager);

### Monthly Usage Estimates

**Small Store** (50 products, 10 admins):
- 100 translations/month: $20
- 50 email campaigns/month: $7.50

---

## Testing Results

### Functional Testing

All endpoints tested and verified:
- ✅ Server starts without errors
- ✅ All 6 features registered successfully
- ✅ Authentication middleware working correctly
- ✅ Input validation functioning properly
- ✅ Health check endpoint responding

### Compilation

TypeScript compilation successful for all new files:
- ✅ `ProductTranslator.ts`
- ✅ `EmailCampaignGenerator.ts`
- ✅ `FAQGenerator.ts`
- ✅ Updated `config.ts`
- ✅ Updated `aiRoutes.ts`

*Note: Some pre-existing TypeScript warnings in unrelated files (media routes, rate limiter) do not affect AI feature functionality.*

---

## Security & Rate Limiting

### Authentication
- All AI endpoints require JWT authentication
- Admin-only access (authenticated via `authMiddleware`)
- User ID tracked in metadata for audit purposes

### Rate Limiting (per user)
- Product Translator: 30 requests/hour
- Email Campaign Generator: 50 requests/hour
- FAQ Generator: 40 requests/hour

### Cost Controls
- Maximum cost per execution enforced
- Cost tracking logged to database
- Real-time cost monitoring available

---

## Caching Strategy

| Feature | Cache Duration | Rationale |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Product Translator | 7 days | Translations rarely change once created |
| Email Campaign Generator | 1 hour | Campaigns often customized per send |
| FAQ Generator | 24 hours | FAQs stable but may need updates |

**Cache Benefits**:
- Reduces API costs for repeated requests
- Faster response times
- Consistent results for identical inputs

---

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

Required in `.env`:
```bash
# OpenAI API Key (stored encrypted in database)
# Add via Admin Panel → Settings → API Keys
# No environment variable needed - retrieved from api_keys table

# JWT for admin authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key

# Database connection (existing)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=luxia
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### API Key Setup

1. Navigate to Admin Panel → Settings → API Keys
2. Find "OpenAI API Key" field
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. Key is automatically encrypted and stored securely
5. AI features will use this key for all operations

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Available Metrics

**Usage Statistics** (`GET /api/admin/ai/usage-stats`):
- Total requests per feature
- Total costs per feature
- Average cost per request
- Total tokens used
- Success/failure rates
- Date range filtering

**Recent Logs** (`GET /api/admin/ai/recent-logs`):
- Last 50-200 operations
- Feature name and status
- Tokens used and cost
- Admin user tracking
- Timestamp

**Provider Status** (`GET /api/admin/ai/providers`):

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Unauthorized" response
- **Solution**: Ensure JWT token is included in Authorization header
- Format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Issue**: "OpenAI API key not configured"
- **Solution**: Add API key in Admin Panel → Settings → API Keys

**Issue**: "Rate limit exceeded"
- **Solution**: Wait for rate limit window to reset (1 hour)
- Or contact administrator to adjust rate limits in config

**Issue**: "Failed to parse response"
- **Solution**: Check AI model compatibility (GPT-4 Turbo recommended)
- Review system prompts for JSON formatting

**Issue**: High costs
- **Solution**: Enable caching (default: enabled)
- Review usage patterns
- Consider lower-cost models for non-critical operations

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Response Times (Average)

| Feature | First Request | Cached Request | Token Count |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
