   - File: routes/user.routes.ts:45
   - Fix: Add authenticate middleware
   - Security risk: Unauthorized users can delete resources

2. SQL injection vulnerability
   - File: repositories/user.repository.ts:78
   - Current: Query uses string interpolation
   - Fix: Use parameterized query with $1 placeholder

HIGH PRIORITY:
3. Missing validation on email field
   - Acceptance criterion not met: "Email must be validated"
   - File: models/user.model.ts
   - Fix: Add .email() validation to Zod schema

4. Tests failing
   - 3 tests failing in user.test.ts
   - Error: Database connection timeout

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
5. Error messages not user-friendly
   - Current: "Validation failed"
   - Expected: Specific field-level errors
   - File: controllers/user.controller.ts:34

SUGGESTIONS:

Please address critical and high priority issues before resubmission.
```

## Testing Approaches

### Manual Testing Frontend

```bash
# Start the application
npm run dev

# Test in browser:
1. Navigate to feature
2. Test happy path
3. Test with invalid inputs
4. Test edge cases (empty, very long, special characters)
5. Test error scenarios
6. Check responsive design (resize browser)
7. Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
8. Check browser console for errors
```

### Manual Testing Backend

```bash
# Use curl or API client (Postman, Insomnia)

# Test happy path
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"SecurePass123"}'

# Test validation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"invalid-email","password":"short"}'

# Test authentication
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users/1
# Should return 401

curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
# Should return user

# Test authorization
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/users/999 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
# Should return 403 if not authorized
```

### Automated Test Review

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Check coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Review coverage report
# Look for:
- Overall coverage > 80%
- Critical business logic > 90%
- All acceptance criteria paths covered
- Edge cases tested
- Error scenarios tested
```

## Common Issues to Check

### Frontend Issues
- **Missing error handling**: No error states or poor error messages
- **Missing loading states**: No feedback during async operations
- **Accessibility violations**: Missing labels, poor contrast, no keyboard support
- **Performance issues**: Unnecessary re-renders, large bundle size
- **TypeScript issues**: Using `any`, missing type definitions
- **Responsive design**: Broken layout on mobile
- **Console errors**: Warnings or errors in browser console

### Backend Issues
- **Missing authentication**: Endpoints not protected
- **Missing authorization**: No ownership checks
- **SQL injection**: String interpolation in queries
- **Missing validation**: Accepting invalid inputs
- **Poor error messages**: Generic or exposing internals
- **Missing tests**: Low coverage or missing edge cases
- **N+1 queries**: Inefficient database operations
- **Missing indexes**: Slow queries on large datasets

### Security Issues
- **Exposed secrets**: API keys or passwords in code
- **Weak authentication**: No token expiration, weak passwords allowed
- **Missing authorization**: Users can access others' resources
- **XSS vulnerabilities**: Unescaped user input
- **CSRF vulnerabilities**: No CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- **Information disclosure**: Error messages revealing system details

## Validation Examples

### Example 1: Approving a Well-Implemented Feature

**Task**: Implement user registration API endpoint

**Validation Result**: APPROVED ✅

**Acceptance Criteria Verification**:
✅ POST /api/users endpoint created
   - Tested: curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users -d '...'
   - Returns 201 with user data

✅ Email validation enforces valid format
   - Tested: Invalid email returns 400 with clear error message
   - Error: "Invalid email format"

✅ Password must be at least 8 characters
   - Tested: Short password rejected with 400
   - Error: "Password must be at least 8 characters"

✅ Password is hashed before storage
   - Verified: Checked database, no plaintext passwords
   - Uses bcrypt with 10 salt rounds

✅ Duplicate emails rejected
   - Tested: Creating user with existing email returns 409
   - Error: "User with this email already exists"

✅ Sensitive data excluded from response
   - Verified: Response does not include password or passwordHash
   - Only returns: id, email, firstName, lastName, createdAt

**Test Coverage**: 92%
- All acceptance criteria have corresponding tests
- Edge cases covered (invalid email, short password, duplicate)
- Error scenarios tested

**Code Quality**: Excellent
- Follows layered architecture (route → controller → service → repository)
- Proper error handling with custom error classes
- Uses Zod for validation
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection

**Security**: All checks passed
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Input validation comprehensive
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Sensitive data not in responses

**Performance**: Good
- Index on email column for duplicate check
- Response time < 200ms

**Ready for deployment** ✅

### Example 2: Requesting Changes

**Task**: Implement user profile update endpoint

**Validation Result**: CHANGES_REQUESTED ⚠️

**Critical Issues**:

1. **Missing authentication middleware**
   - File: `routes/user.routes.ts:25`
   - Current: `router.put('/:id', validate(updateUserSchema), userController.update)`
   - Issue: Any unauthenticated user can update any profile
   - Fix: Add `authenticate` middleware before validation
   - Acceptance criterion NOT met: "Only authenticated users can update profiles"

2. **Missing authorization check**
   - File: `services/user.service.ts:45`
   - Issue: Users can update other users' profiles
   - Fix: Add check `if (user.id !== requestingUserId) throw new ForbiddenError()`
   - Acceptance criterion NOT met: "Users can only update their own profile"

**High Priority Issues**:

3. **Tests are failing**
   - File: `__tests__/user.test.ts`
   - 2 out of 5 tests failing
   - Error: "Cannot read property 'id' of null"
   - Fix: Mock database responses properly

4. **Validation too permissive**
   - File: `models/user.model.ts:15`
   - Issue: Allows updating email without verification
   - Security risk: Email hijacking
   - Fix: Remove email from update schema or add verification flow

**Medium Priority**:

5. **Error handling incomplete**
   - File: `controllers/user.controller.ts:28`
   - No try-catch wrapper
   - Unhandled errors crash the application
   - Fix: Add try-catch and call next(error)

**Suggestions** (not blockers):
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Add audit log for profile changes
- Consider adding email change confirmation flow

**Must fix critical and high priority issues before resubmission.**
